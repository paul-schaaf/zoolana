# Zoolana - a p2p meeting app on Solana

Zoolana is a meeting app that uses the Solana blockchain as a signaling server to establish p2p WebRTC calls.

WebRTC enables p2p communication between browsers but the two browsers still need to find each other on the internet. For this, a signaling server is used to which both parties send their browser info. Zoolana uses Solana as a signaling server, creating an always online and free to use (apart from tx fees) signaling server.
